  abstract    = {Square-based fiducial markers are one of the most popular approaches for camera pose estimation due to its fast detection and robustness. In order to maximize their error correction capabilities, it is required to use an inner binary codification with a large inter-marker distance. This paper proposes two Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approaches to generate configurable square-based fiducial marker dictionaries maximizing their inter-marker distance. The first approach guarantees the optimal solution, however, it can only be applied to relatively small dictionaries and number of bits since the computing times are too long for many situations. The second approach is an alternative formulation to obtain suboptimal dictionaries within restricted time, achieving results that still surpass significantly the current state of the art methods.}

  abstract      = {Squared planar markers have become a popular method for pose estimation in applications such as autonomous robots, unmanned vehicles and virtual trainers. The markers allow estimating the position of a monocular camera with minimal cost, high robustness, and speed. One only needs to create markers with a regular printer, place them in the desired environment so as to cover the working area, and then registering their location from a set of images. Nevertheless, marker detection is a time-consuming process, especially as the image dimensions grows. Modern cameras are able to acquire high resolutions images, but fiducial marker systems are not adapted in terms of computing speed. This paper proposes a multi-scale strategy for speeding up marker detection in video sequences by wisely selecting the most appropriate scale for detection, identification and corner estimation. The experiments conducted show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing accuracy or robustness. Our method is up to 40 times faster than the state-of-the-art method, achieving over 1000 fps in 4 K images without any parallelization.}

abstract = {The current disruptive innovation in civilian drone (UAV) applications has led to an increased need for research and development in UAV technology. The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research. This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone platform elements that can be used for research and development. The survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone platforms and compares their main features.}
